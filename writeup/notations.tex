\section{Notations}\label{Se:Notations}

We write $\_$ to denote an immaterial value, which is implicitly existentially quantified, 
and $\bot$ to denote the undefined value.
%a function which is not defined anywhere.
We denote the \emph{size} (number of elements) of a set $A$ by $|A|$.
We write $f: A \to B$ and $f: A \partialto B$ to denote a \emph{total}, respectively, \emph{partial}, function from $A$ to $B$. We denote the \emph{domain of definition} and \emph{range} of a function $f:A \partialto  B$ by $\dom(f)$ and $\range(f)$, respectively,
i.e., $\dom(f) = \{a \in A \mid f(a) \neq \bot \}$ and $\range(f)=\{b \in B \mid \exists a.\, f(a)=b\}$.
% (Note that   $\dom(f) \subseteq A$ and $\range(f)\subseteq B$.)
% We denote the \emph{domain (of definition)} and \emph{range} of a (partial) function $f:A \partialto  B$ by
% $\dom(f) \subseteq A$ and $\range(f)\subseteq B$.
We write $f:A \partialto_{\mathit{fin}} B$ to denote that $f$ has a finite  domain.
We denote the set of natural numbers (including zero) by $\mathbb{N}$. We  write
$\{m..n\}$,   for some $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$, to denote the set of integers $\{ i \in \mathbb{N} \mid m \leq i \land i \leq n\}$. 
A \emph{sequence $\pi=a_1,\ldots,a_n$ over a set $A$} is  a function  $\pi:\{1..n\} \to A $, from $\{1..n\}$, for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, to $A$. 
We denote the \emph{length} of $\pi$ by $|\pi|=|\dom(\pi)|$, and its $i$th element, 
for $i\in \{1..|\pi|\}$, by $\pi(i)$.
We denote the \emph{empty sequence} by $\epsilon$, and the concatenation of sequences $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ by % juxtoposition 
$\pi_1 \cdot \pi_2$.  
We denote the set of sequences over a set $A$ by $\overline{A}$.
% We use $\overline{\cdot}$ to denote sequences. 
% All sequences are indexed starting from $1$.
